## Introduction
We've been given the job of creating a platform for Parantion to manage their manual regression testing.
This website will help keep track of test issues, who's handling them, their weights, and the steps involved. Our aim is to make a user-friendly platform that uses a database to make managing testing easy for Parantion.
