# SCRUM DOCUMENTATION
# Startup  - Scrum Master - Jafar
In Startup stage, our primary focus was on establishing the groundwork for our Scrum Documentation. Our goal was to
organize the team effectively, analyze project assignments thoroughly, and ultimately produce a validated functional 
design and basic architecture. This stage serves as the project's foundational cornerstone, setting the tone for 
organized collaboration and providing a clear roadmap for subsequent sprints. As we this initial phase, our commitment 
to meticulous planning and a well-defined structure reflects our dedication to ensuring the success of the entire Scrum
process.
