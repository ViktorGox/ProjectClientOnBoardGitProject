### Code of Conduct
Our team is committed to creating a productive and positive working environment that fosters teamwork and
collaboration. In order to achieve this goal, we have developed a Code of Conduct that outlines our expectations for
team members.

We expect all team members to put in their fair share of work and complete their assigned tasks on time.
We understand that unexpected events may arise, but we expect team members to communicate any issues they
are experiencing as soon as possible. Effective communication is crucial for our team's success. We expect all
team members to communicate clearly and promptly, whether it be through Discord, email, or in-person conversations.
This includes informing the team if there are any personal or external issues that may impact their ability to
complete their assigned tasks.

Respect is another key aspect of our team's culture. We expect all team members to treat each other with respect
and consideration. This means being mindful of others' time, opinions, and feelings, and refraining from any behavior
that could be considered bullying, harassment, or discrimination.

Accountability is crucial to the success of our project. We expect all team members to fulfill their responsibilities
and to communicate clearly and honestly with the rest of the team. If a team member fails to complete their work
between stand-up meetings, an explanation is required. In this case, if the explanation is "I didn't have the
motivation," the team will accept it, but the member will be expected to catch up and spend double the time to
make up for the missed work.

If a team member fails to complete their work for a second time and the explanation is simply "I was lazy," without
a legitimate reason such as illness, then a strike will be issued. Craig will be notified of the strike, and the
team member will be expected to catch up and spend double the time to make up for the missed work. We believe that
this approach will encourage all team members to take their responsibilities seriously and to work together to
achieve our goals.

We have established a meeting schedule to ensure regular communication and collaboration within our team. We have
planned to hold three meetings each week, typically scheduled for Monday, Wednesday, and Friday. This means that we
would have enough time between meetings for us to make progress. These meetings will serve as
valuable opportunities for us to discuss project progress, address any challenges, and plan next steps. Of course, due
to unexpected circumstances sometimes our meetings might not happen on the scheduled days, but then they will just be
rescheduled.

Sometimes meetings will be held in Discord. This will be our main platform for communication. Discord
offers features such as screen sharing and voice chat, enabling us to have interactive and productive meetings. It
provides flexibility in terms of scheduling the meetings at a suitable time for all team members, regardless of their
physical location.

Finally, continuous improvement is crucial for our team's success. We are committed to continuously improving
our processes and our team members. This means actively seeking feedback and constructive criticism, and being
open to making changes when necessary.

By agreeing to this Code of Conduct, we believe that our team can accomplish our project goals.
