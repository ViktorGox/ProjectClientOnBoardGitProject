## Start up

Scrum Master - Jafar

In Startup stage, our primary focus was on establishing the groundwork
for our Scrum Documentation. Our goal was to
organize the team effectively, analyze project assignments thoroughly,
and ultimately produce a validated functional 
design and basic architecture. This stage serves as the project's 
foundational cornerstone, setting the tone for 
organized collaboration and providing a clear roadmap for subsequent 
sprints. As we this initial phase, our commitment 
to meticulous planning and a well-defined structure reflects our 
dedication to ensuring the success of the entire Scrum
process.

### Retrospectives

#### Jafar

During the initial phase of our startup, I took on the role of the scrum master in the first week. This involved 
creating the initial project structure, setting up requirement issues, and initiating key Scrum documentation such as
parts of the team plan, PoA, and DoD. As the organizer and facilitator of team meetings, I ensured that our discussions
were focused on meeting project requirements and maintaining project timelines.
In addition to my managerial responsibilities, I actively contributed to the project's technical aspects. This included 
working on the functional design and playing a pivotal role in the creation of the PoA and requirements. Throughout the
sprint, I gained insights into the documentation and the necessity
for clear and concise requirements from the project's inception. Moving forward, I recognize the importance of fostering
early and continuous communication among team members to enhance collaboration and overall efficiency. 
The positive outcomes achieved during this sprint, notably the completion of documentation and the establishment of a
template code structure, stand as motivating milestones for our team as we transition into the next phase of our project.

#### Viktor

During start up stage, Sprint 0, the group started doing the documentation required to lay 
the foundations for the project. I personally made about 10-15 requirements, which I 
added to gitlab. Worked on the PoA file. In the second week I read through all 
requirements that the group had made and noted which ones are bad, good, 
duplicates and any other note I had about them. On the second meeting I talked 
with the group about the notes I made and we cleaned the requirements. In our 
meeting on saturday where we finalized the documentation, I made the technical 
design and added more information about the meetings.

#### Alex

I concentrated on creating a stoner-friendly interface that aligns with the design conditions. 
The runner displays test way with applicable details similar as ID, name, weight, 
and completion state. I enforced interactive features, allowing druggies to click on a test 
to punctuate it and change its completion state. 
To enhance collaboration, I integrated the frontal end with the aft end, enabling flawless 
communication between the two. This involved running asynchronous requests for costing and streamlining test way. also, 
I worked on a point that allows druggies to add new test way, contributing to the overall functionality of the operation.

#### Yaroslav

At the start of this project, I was working on our project documentation. I build several diagrams
for our frontend pages, also added functional and non-functional requirements. I was not present on our first class, as
I got a flu, but still I worked actively during this sprint. During our meetings I explained that we had a
misunderstanding in our requirements and functional design, which lead whole team to study materials about requirements
and then we built them correctly.

#### Justin

At the project's start, I worked on documents, like the code of conduct, and tweaked some requirements. In this sprint, I took on designing the database, which you can find in the functional design. It was tricky because everyone had different ideas.

A challenge we faced was communication issues due to different schedules. Personally, I prefer not to work evenings to spend time with family and friends. Unfortunately, this meant missing some Saturday meetings, as I'm committed to work that day.

To improve, I'll be more flexible and plan sessions proactively to ensure I can participate.
#### Rub√©n
[]
#### Ferhat
I've been a bit busy with my work and other meetings that in the first two weeks. I tried my best to attend all
the classes and meetings. So far, our focus has been on the documentation and designs. I've created wireframes and
added them to Technical Document, explaining the functionality they provide to the user. Additionally, I've included business
requirements in the functional design documentation. We've also discussed the project's boundaries and risks, and I've
documented those in the Plan of Approach. Moving forward, I plan to maintain a balance between work and meetings to enhance
my productivity for the team, ensuring active participation in our upcoming meetings.

## Sprint 1
*First coding*

### Meeting 8 - 5.12.2023
Scrum Master - Justin

During this meeting we discussed our progress and problems that each member encountered during the work.
Main problem was that we all focused on creating basic frontend for all the pages we have planned. As a result, big
components were created that were only suitable for one specific page and could not be used for other pages, which
lead to lots of code duplications. For backend, we kept working on the database and built some starting routers for
the server. We were only about to switch to basic js instead of typescript, so some system files and js files
which had typescript code should be changed in the backend.

### Meeting 9 - 7.12.2023
Scrum Master - Justin

At this meeting some of our members shared that they have problems using bootstrap library for frontend styling. So
we grouped up and helped each other to understand some basic principles of bootstrap. It made code with bootstrap
readable for everyone and we moved on splitting our tasks. About three main pages were ready, and we had to finalize
database design to know if we were missing something.

Jafar,
Justin,
Ferhat,
Viktor,
Alex,
Ruben,
Yaroslav

### Meeting 10 - 12.12.2023 9:30
Scrum Master - Ruben

In this meeting, discussed what we did on the tasks that we assigned to each other and what else needs to be done. We
then worked on the main page and also with database.

We will use status to change issues from one column to another one.
We decided to split our work in each page. I mean that 2 of us will 
work in the same page(one doing frontend, another one doing backend).

### Meeting 11 - 14.12.2023 10:00
Scrum Master - Ruben

In this meeting, discussed what we did on the tasks that we assigned to each other and what else needs to be done. 
We then worked on the main page.
The database has been created, and from here we can work with the backend and see results.
Each member of the group has an assigned task, so we have to keep working

### End of sprint 1
Board at the End Of Sprint

![](.Scrum Document_images/26541e37.png)

One issue that was planned to be done remained, and that was the possibility to attach files. The assigned person was unable to finish it. So it will be moved to the next sprint.

### Burn down chart
![](.Scrum Document_images/35f6f8ae.png)

The burn down chart started out low, as we had not yet had the starting meeting. The first increase is that first meeting, where we created a backlog for it. The reason it does not go down after, is that the choice of issues was not good enough, and we had to continuously add new issue throughout the sprint.

### Retrospectives

#### Jafar
#### Viktor
#### Alex
#### Yaroslav
#### Justin
#### Rub√©n
#### Ferhat

This sprint, me and my friend have done the database together. But we had to change it twice. Now it's much better than previous one.
Probably we will change small things on database but, it shouldn't be a problem.
We had to change the database because of the leek of communication with our teacher and client. We thought we can use
a database management system that we are not allow to use, that's why we had to change the database.
For next time I will make sure that we are allow to use what we want to use before implementing it.

## Sprint 2
*Slight downfall*

### Meeting 12 - 19.12.2023 10:00
Scrum Master - Yaroslav

During meeting 12 we discussed front and back end implementations that we have achieved. Viktor generified work
for requests for backend and frontend. We still saw that this generic solution has to be improved to be used with ease.
We progressed with test overview, sprint overview, and test edit pages on frontend. For backend we had some issues
with the database, so we decided to fix it and keep working on database controllers.

### Meeting 13 - 21.12.2023 16:00
Scrum Master - Yaroslav

Generic functions were improved, so it was possible to use them for controllers in the backend. Our team had troubles
with frontend pages design, as each page had its own style. We had to work on creating similar design for all pages, 
so that style would not be that different. We started building nice controllers/routers for backend and
frontend, using generic functionality for fetch requests. We split tasks to be done for holidays.

### Meeting 14 - 09.01.2024 16:00
Scrum Master - Alex

This was our first meeting after holidays. We analysed what has been done. Frontend design was more shared between the
pages, there were still a lot of work to do to make it look better and make it more user-friendly. For backend, most
parts were done, some members had issues with the database queries, so we fixed them together. We decided to focus
on optimizing our code further.

Ruben,

### Meeting 15 - 11.01.2024 16:00
Scrum Master - Alex

In our 15th meeting, we continued making significant progress on both the front-end and the remaining backend tasks. 
The changes made during the holiday period were reviewed, and the team acknowledged the improvements in frontend design with a more cohesive and shared style across pages.
However, it was noted that there was still work to be done to enhance the overall user-friendliness and appearance.

![](.Scrum Document_images/29345dc4.png)

One issue remained. Due to also doing other tasks, this one remained unfinished. It will be moved to the next sprint.

### Burn down chart
![](.Scrum Document_images/b95fe58c.png)

Due to miscommunication in our team, the git board was not handled 
properly, and issue were not added in the start, but gradually being 
completed and new ones being added. 

### Retrospectives

#### Jafar
#### Viktor

#### Alex

During the alternate sprint, my focus was on expanding the functionality of the test step runner 
by enforcing the capability to add new test way. I successfully integrated the frontal page of test steps
This involved running asynchronous requests backend, allowing for the creation of new test way.
In addition to the front-end work, I took on the responsibility of developing the entire backend sense for managing test steps.
This included handling requests to produce, update, and recoup test way, facing a smooth inflow of data between the customer and the website.
I laboriously banded with platoon members to align the functionality with design conditions,
making necessary adaptations grounded on feedback. The integration of the new test step functionality enhances the overall stoner experience and contributes to the design's pretensions.

#### Yaroslav
#### Justin
#### Rub√©n
#### Ferhat
During this sprint, my focus was changing API calls for users, middlewares, and creating token. I was done with these last sprint but
we have changed the database for users and I had to change it from the backend. Then my friend Viktor created a generic class
for queries and I had to change again. At the end we were done with the whole backend, with using generic class.
Communication could've been much better, but it wasn't the worst. If my team-mate told me that he was working on generic 
class for backend, I wouldn't work on API calls for users and would have work on something else for the project.
For next time, I would say everyone should be more clear what they are working on.

## Sprint 3
*The redemption*

### Meeting 16 - 16.01.2024 9:00
Scrum Master - Viktor

Right after this meeting, we had scheduled an on place meeting with the client, so we set up this meeting, so we can talk about what we are going to show. As well as clear up the gitlab board, ideas for next sprint will be set up during/after client meeting.

### Meeting 17 - 16.01.2024 11:15
Scrum Master - Viktor

This was the client meeting, we should Nick what we have so far, and what we got to finish. He gave us a lot of feedback on what we have to do, improvements and gaps in our logic. He was sceptical that we can finish everything in just 9 days, and so were we. After the end of the client meeting, with the knowledge of how much there is to do, we agreed to do a daily meeting for this and next week, so we can finish the project. We also set up a meeting for later that day, so we can distribute tasks, so we can start from today.

Present:
Jafar,
Viktor,
Justin,
Ruben,

Absent:
Ferhat - sick,
Yaroslav - sick

### Meeting 18 - 16.01.2024 17:00
Scrum Master - Viktor

This meeting was later the same day as the client meeting, as we found out that we have more work ahead of us that behind us, we distributed tasks to be started, and finished as soon as possible, possibly by next day.

These were the tasks that we assigned to each other.

```
Yaroslav -> move test table to dashbaord, add add test case button to testoveview, remove checkbox and status in testcaseoverview only. Dashboard test case status from dropdown. Style of sprint page. Click on entire test case.
Viktor -> sort by wiehgt, remove differnet role from databse, add statusid to jucntion table. Redirect to log in if not logged in. Fix id in test case overvierw page. ???

### Meeting 19 - 17.01.2024 22:40
Scrum Master - Viktor

This meeting was the day after we decided to do daily meetings. We first looked at what tasks were finished. 

Done:
```
Yaroslav -> move test table to dashbaord, add add test case button to testoveview, remove checkbox and status in testcaseoverview only. 
Viktor -> sort by wiehgt, remove differnet role from databse, add statusid to jucntion table. Redirect to log in if not logged in. Fix id in test case overvierw page. ???

Alex -> 
Justin -> finish notification, eimail notifications, remove profile and setting from header dro pdown. maybe
```

Remaining:

```
Yaroslav -> Dashboard test case status from dropdown. Style of sprint page. Click on entire test case.
Viktor -> Fix id in test case overvierw page. ???
Ruben ->
Ferhat -> User page -> create user, change passowrd/email, and role
Jafar -> sprintdetails page
Alex -> test step page
Justin -> 
```

Good start, some of the tasks that were given were too big for one day to finish, or a lot of small tasks, so that is the reason some people do not have finished tasks.

We then gave new tasks to everyone, or just reassigned old ones, that need to be finished.

```
Ruben- sprint detail
Viktor - attahcment table, files, dashboard, testcase ovewrview fix, back end for attachments, ?and comments?,  put test by id? all usernames returns id too, fix test status stuff, fix put request error
Alex - test step page
Yaroslav - All sprints page, rmeove chekcbox from table
Justin - Nofirtaion/email? + dev ops?/Jafar

This was the last meeting before the final client meeting where we had to present the product. Everyone was hard at work to finish up any remaining tasks. Justin managed to get the docker images for the website. Viktor managed to get in the restart sprint. Ferhat, Ruben and Alex and Yaroslav implemented the middlewares for the different user roles and fixed some bugs. Jafar finished up the readme file. 

With all of this, we had pretty much done everything we wanted to do with the website. While it has many flaws, we were happy with it.

Finally, we are done with the project. In this sprint we all worked on frontend. Unfortunately, I was sick on 7th week.
I have done line and donut chart for
sprint dashboard. It was hard coded before, now it's connected to backend and shows how many tests have passed and how many
tests needs to be done in that sprint.
Nothing went wrong, everything was good with my team-mates, and we have finished the project on time. We were much better
with communication part as well. At the end we are delivering a web application that has a role-based login system that you
can create sprints, tests and test steps. We are happy with our project now.
