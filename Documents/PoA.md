## 1. Introduction

This document will describe the Plan of Approach for the group project "Client on Board" in the 2nd quartile of the second year for 2023/2024. The client that has created the assignment is Parantion. The product we are asked to deliver is a solution in the form of a program for performing automatic regression testing.

VIKTOR WILL CONTINUE THIS!

## 2. Background

Dynamic Deventer company Parantion is looking to streamline its JetBrains Space-managed manual regression testing procedure. The company envisions a web-based system that will allow administrators to manage test cases, configure sprints, and track progress in order to address inefficiencies.

**Frontend:** In keeping with Parantion's innovation objectives, the team chooses **Svelte**, a platform renowned for its performance and simplicity, which offers a responsive user interface.

**Backend:** Using **TypeScript** in conjunction with **Express.js** guarantees a strong, statically-typed base for server-side functions.

**Database:** The inclusion of MySQL enhances data management capabilities, providing a reliable and scalable solution for storing and retrieving essential information.

This technology stack, which includes TypeScript and Svelte, not only fits with the team's experience but also presents the Regression Testing Management System as a cutting-edge option. Future improvements are supported by the iterative development methodology, which guarantees that the system adapts to Parantion's changing requirements for dynamic testing.

## 5. Borders and Risk

There are some potential challenges, limitations and risks that may affect the project.

* One of our teammates might not put in their expected time and effort into the project, which could affect our overall effort and project's timeline.
* If a teammate doesn't pull before pushing the code, it will cause merge conflicts for others.
* Less communication with teammates can lead to problems in finishing the project on time.
* Not choosing a programming language that everyone agrees for this project might cause delays in completing the project on time.
* Not attending the class on time might create problems in catching up with the project.
* Insufficient testing, during development and before deployment can cause critical issues in the project.
* If the project objectives are not well-defined, it can cause to confusion and a lack of a focus.
* Changes in project requirements after starting development can cause delays and may require significant adjustments to the existing work.
* Insufficient documentation of code, processes and decisions can make it difficult for team members to understand and maintain the project.
