## 1. Introduction

This document will describe the Plan of Approach for the group project "Client on Board" in the 2nd quartile of the second year for 2023/2024. The name of the company that made the assignment is Parantion. The product we are asked to deliver is a solution in the form of a program for managing performance automatic regression testing.

The plan will cover everything from understanding what Parantion needs to looking at how other people do similar things in the software world. We'll decide what our program needs to do and how it should work. We know that things might not always go smoothly. Thus, we'll think ahead about what could go wrong and come up with ways to fix problems quickly. This way, we can keep the project moving forward.

## 2. Background

Dynamic Deventer company Parantion is looking to streamline its JetBrains Space-managed manual regression testing procedure. The company envisions a web-based system that will allow administrators to manage test cases, configure sprints, and track progress in order to address inefficiencies.

**Frontend:** In keeping with Parantion's innovation objectives, the team chooses **Svelte**, a platform renowned for its performance and simplicity, which offers a responsive user interface.

**Backend:** Using **TypeScript** in conjunction with **Express.js** guarantees a strong, statically-typed base for server-side functions.

**Database:** The inclusion of MySQL enhances data management capabilities, providing a reliable and scalable solution for storing and retrieving essential information.

This technology stack, which includes TypeScript and Svelte, not only fits with the team's experience but also presents the Regression Testing Management System as a cutting-edge option. Future improvements are supported by the iterative development methodology, which guarantees that the system adapts to Parantion's changing requirements for dynamic testing.


## 3. Results


- Implementing a websocket, will allow for immediate reporting of blockers encountered during testing.
  It will provide real-time notifications to relevant stakeholders when blockers are identified. It will be easier to solve problems.
- Regression Test Reporting:
  Reporting system provides a clear overview of completed regression tests for each part of the project.
  Detailed reports could include information on passed and failed tests, allowing for a quick assessment of the product's stability.
- Board Reset for New Sprint:
  Development of a feature that allows for easy resetting of a new testing board to streamline the transition to a new sprint
  could involve archiving previous test data and configurations for a clean slate.
- Progression Tracking Based on Weight:
  This could provide insights into the overall progress of testing based on the assigned weight to different test cases.
- Test Due Date Notifications:
  Integration of a notification system to remind testers about upcoming test.
  This feature ensures that testing activities stay on schedule, so they can get it easier, contributing to timely product development.

## 4. Organization

In terms of organization, each team member has a specific role and responsibilities. The team works closely together to
communicate effectively and complete tasks efficiently. Team management tools and social media platforms, such as
Discord and Google Docs, are used to stay in touch and share documents. The project is broken down into smaller tasks
for each sprint, and after discussing and deciding on the tasks, each team member is responsible for completing them in
a timely manner. tri-weekly meetings are held at university and additional meetings can be scheduled as needed. The team
also uses Discord and video conferencing to stay in touch outside the classroom. Feedback is encouraged and used to
improve the work of the team. However, in case a team member does not complete their task or does not show up,
the following steps will be taken: first with communication and reminder, then consequences such as warning or strikes,
and at the end, escalation to the instructor if the problem persists. It is important to keep in mind that the team is
a cohesive unit and everyone's contributions are important for the success of the project. Therefore, non-compliance or
non-attendance issues should be addressed in a timely and professional manner and a solution that is fair for the whole
team should be found.

We will follow Scrum roles:
Product Owner: Justin Fuchs
Developers: Jafar Alirahmi-Viktor Krastev-Rubén Gómez-Yaroslav Peptiuk-Aleks Proskurkin-Ferhat Kelten


## 5. Borders and Risk

There are some potential challenges, limitations and risks that may affect the project.

* One of our teammates might not put in their expected time and effort into the project, which could affect our overall effort and project's timeline.
* If a teammate doesn't pull before pushing the code, it will cause merge conflicts for others.
* Less communication with teammates can lead to problems in finishing the project on time.
* Not choosing a programming language that everyone agrees for this project might cause delays in completing the project on time.
* Not attending the class on time might create problems in catching up with the project.
* Insufficient testing, during development and before deployment can cause critical issues in the project.
* If the project objectives are not well-defined, it can cause to confusion and a lack of a focus.
* Changes in project requirements after starting development can cause delays and may require significant adjustments to the existing work.
* Insufficient documentation of code, processes and decisions can make it difficult for team members to understand and maintain the project.


## 6. Conclusion

In summary, our Plan of Approach lays out a practical strategy for building a regression testing system tailored to Parantion's needs. We've chosen a tech stack that makes sense and outlined features that aim to improve testing efficiency. Team organization follows Scrum principles for a structured workflow.
in the Borders and Risk chapter we have identified potential challenges like time management and code integration and have plans to deal with them. Simply put, our plan is focused towards delivering a solution that meets Parantion's requirements.
