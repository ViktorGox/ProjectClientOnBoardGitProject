## 1. Introduction

This is the POA document for Team 3 in this document w
## 2. Background

Dynamic Deventer company Parantion is looking to streamline its JetBrains Space-managed manual regression testing procedure. The company envisions a web-based system that will allow administrators to manage test cases, configure sprints, and track progress in order to address inefficiencies.

**Frontend:** In keeping with Parantion's innovation objectives, the team chooses **Svelte**, a platform renowned for its performance and simplicity, which offers a responsive user interface.

**Backend:** Using **TypeScript** in conjunction with **Express.js** guarantees a strong, statically-typed base for server-side functions.

This technology stack, which includes TypeScript and Svelte, not only fits with the team's experience but also presents the Regression Testing Management System as a cutting-edge option. Future improvements are supported by the iterative development methodology, which guarantees that the system adapts to Parantion's changing requirements for dynamic testing.
