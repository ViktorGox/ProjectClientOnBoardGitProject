## 1. Introduction



## 2. Background

Dynamic Deventer company Parantion is looking to streamline its JetBrains Space-managed manual regression testing procedure. The company envisions a web-based system that will allow administrators to manage test cases, configure sprints, and track progress in order to address inefficiencies.

**Frontend:** In keeping with Parantion's innovation objectives, the team chooses **Svelte**, a platform renowned for its performance and simplicity, which offers a responsive user interface.

**Backend:** Using **TypeScript** in conjunction with **Express.js** guarantees a strong, statically-typed base for server-side functions.

**Database:** The inclusion of MySQL enhances data management capabilities, providing a reliable and scalable solution for storing and retrieving essential information.

This technology stack, which includes TypeScript and Svelte, not only fits with the team's experience but also presents the Regression Testing Management System as a cutting-edge option. Future improvements are supported by the iterative development methodology, which guarantees that the system adapts to Parantion's changing requirements for dynamic testing.

## 4. Organization

In terms of organization, each team member has a specific role and responsibilities. The team works closely together to
communicate effectively and complete tasks efficiently. Team management tools and social media platforms, such as
Discord and Google Docs, are used to stay in touch and share documents. The project is broken down into smaller tasks
for each sprint, and after discussing and deciding on the tasks, each team member is responsible for completing them in
a timely manner. triweekly meetings are held at university and additional meetings can be scheduled as needed. The team
also uses Discord and video conferencing to stay in touch outside of the classroom. Feedback is encouraged and used to
improve the work of the team. However, in case a team member does not complete their task or does not show up,
the following steps will be taken: first with communication and reminder, then consequences such as warning or strikes,
and at the end, escalation to the instructor if the problem persists. It is important to keep in mind that the team is
a cohesive unit and everyone's contributions are important for the success of the project. Therefore, non-compliance or
non-attendance issues should be addressed in a timely and professional manner and a solution that is fair for the whole
team should be found.

We will follow Scrum roles:
Product Owner: Justin Fuchs
Developers: Jafar Alirahmi-Viktor Krastev-Rubén Gómez-Yaroslav Peptiuk-Aleks Proskurkin-Ferhat Kelten
