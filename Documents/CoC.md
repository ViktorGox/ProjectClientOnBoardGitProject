# Code of Conduct

## Punctuality and Attendance
- Every team member is expected to arrive on time and be present in every class and meeting.
- In case of absence, the absent member must inform all other team members and the lecturer.

## Task Assignment and Communication
- All group members are required to work on their assigned tasks.
- If a task is deemed too difficult or incompletable, the team member must report back to others.
- Effective communication is essential for the success of the team.


## Conflict Resolution
- In case of conflicts between team members, the team shall attempt to resolve the issue internally.
- If internal resolution is unsuccessful, the matter will be brought to the attention of the lecturer.

## Personal Challenges
- If a team member cannot complete their work due to personal reasons, immediate notification to the team is required.
- The team will collectively ensure that the tasks of the affected member are appropriately redistributed.

## Meeting Etiquette
- During meetings, maintain a professional and focused environment.
- Avoid disruptions, side conversations, or unrelated activities.

## Confidentiality and Plagiarism
- Information and work shared among group members must remain within the group.
- To prevent plagiarism, members should refrain from sharing their codes with other students.

## Respect
- Team members are expected to treat each other with respect.

## Accountability and Responsibility
- Each team member is accountable for their assigned tasks and responsibilities.
- If a member is unable to fulfill their duties, they should proactively seek assistance or delegate tasks.
- Accountability is crucial to the success of our project. We expect all team members to fulfill their responsibilities
  and to communicate clearly and honestly with the rest of the team. If a team member fails to complete their work
  between stand-up meetings, an explanation is required. In this case, if the explanation is "I didn't have the
  motivation," the team will accept it, but the member will be expected to catch up and spend double the time to
  make up for the missed work.

- If a team member fails to complete their work for a second time and the explanation is simply "I was lazy," without
  a legitimate reason such as illness, then a strike will be issued. Eelco will be notified of the strike, and the
  team member will be expected to catch up and spend double the time to make up for the missed work.

## Communication Channels
- Utilize designated communication channels (e.g., messaging apps, email) for team discussions and updates.
- Respond promptly to team messages and notifications.

## Documentation and Transparency
- Keep thorough documentation of individual and group progress.
- Be transparent about challenges, setbacks, and changes in project timelines.

## Contribution Equality
- Strive for an equitable distribution of tasks among team members.
- Encourage and value the diverse skills and perspectives each member brings.

## Iterative Feedback
- Provide constructive and respectful feedback to team members on their work.
- Embrace a culture of continuous improvement and learning.

## Technology and Tool Usage
- Follow agreed-upon guidelines for using collaborative tools and technologies.
- Ensure that all team members have access to necessary tools and resources.

## Adherence to Academic Integrity
- Uphold academic integrity standards and avoid any form of cheating or plagiarism.
- Cite sources appropriately and adhere to any academic guidelines provided by the lecturer.

## Flexibility and Adaptability
- Be open to adapting plans and strategies based on the evolving needs of the project.
- Embrace a flexible mindset to navigate unexpected challenges.

## Professionalism
- Conduct yourself in a professional manner in all interactions within the team and with external stakeholders.
- Represent the team positively in academic and professional settings.

## Conflict of Interest
- Disclose any potential conflicts of interest that may impact the team or project.
- Work collaboratively to find solutions that mitigate conflicts and maintain the team's integrity.

## Consequences for Violations
