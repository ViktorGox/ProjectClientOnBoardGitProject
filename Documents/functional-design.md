## Introduction



## Requirements

The requirements for this project have been split into functional and non-functional requirements.

### Functional

- FR1 - The system should save data when a board is closed to be included in reports later.
- FR2 - Users want the ability to change test status by moving it to another board or selecting a new status on the test page for progress monitoring.
- FR3 - Parantion testers require the ability to mark a test case as a blocker to highlight serious bugs.
- FR4 - Parantion manager need to assign a weight to each task of a test case, and the total weight should be shown per test case.
- FR5 - Parantion manager should be able to create test cases and assign them to columns for better organization.
- FR6 - Paration managers require the ability to close boards to conclude sprints.
- FR7 - Paration manager participants want a new board created when an old one is closed, and data from the old one moved to the new one for organization.
- FR8 - Parantion admin testers should be able to create columns in boards for organizing test cases.
- FR9 - Parantion manager want the ability to assign due dates for tests when creating them for clear timelines.
- FR10 - Managers should be able to edit roles of other users for efficient role management.
- FR11 - The system must meet safety and security standards to protect all confidential data belonging to involved parties.
- FR12 - The system should allow sorting of tests by weight per column.
- FR13 - The system must generate reports on the completion status of regression test runs per sprint and product, including details on tests, testers, failed/passed tests, time taken, and weight.
- FR14 - Testers should be able to document test steps, log bugs with links to test cases, and update test case content.
- FR15 - Parantion manager want to add and remove testers to have control over the system.
- FR16 - Managers should be able to assign and unassign testers to tests for clear task allocation.
- FR17 - Parantion users want to see an overview of the current tests in the system.
- FR18 - Parantion management participants want to add tests to keep track of ongoing testing.
- FR19 - Parantion management participants should be able to edit added tests to correct errors.
- FR20 - Parantion testers want to search tests by name across the whole board for quicker access.
- FR621 - The system should notify testers about tests that have passed their deadline.
- FR22 - The system should notify testers about tests that are due soon.
- FR23 - The system should immediately send a notification via WebSocket upon detecting a blocking issue.
