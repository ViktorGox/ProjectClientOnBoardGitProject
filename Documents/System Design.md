## General Overview and Approach


## Design Considerations


# System Architecture

## Framework Choices

We decided to use Svelte for front end, since we had a course last quartile and have some experience with it.
We also decided to use typescript for both front end and back end. We decided that it will be good for us, since its close to javascript, and we would like to learn it.
For database we decided to use MySQL, no really concrete reasons why it over others.
