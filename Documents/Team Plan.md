# Team plan

## Targets
- To carry out this project successfully we have to increase our programming skills, specifically
  with TypeScript. Not all members know this language, so we must learn and practice.
- Successfully complete all the requirements that Parantion has asked of us.
- Be able to complete all proposed tasks on time.
- As a team we want to be organized. There will be 3 weekly meetings to advance the project 
  and talk to each other to assign tasks.
- We want to be an efficient team. To do this, first we need to be organized and, from here, 
  we have to work hard
- We must cooperate and help each other. If we avoid conflicts we will have a happy and motivated 
  team. There will be peace and you will be able to work better

## Code of Conduct
### Punctuality and Attendance
- Every team member is expected to arrive on time and be present in every class and meeting.
- In case of absence, the absent member must inform all other team members and the lecturer.

### Task Assignment and Communication
- All group members are required to work on their assigned tasks.
- If a task is deemed too difficult or incompletable, the team member must report back to others.
- Effective communication is essential for the success of the team.


### Conflict Resolution
- In case of conflicts between team members, the team shall attempt to resolve the issue internally.
- If internal resolution is unsuccessful, the matter will be brought to the attention of the lecturer.

### Personal Challenges
- If a team member cannot complete their work due to personal reasons, immediate notification to the team is required.
- The team will collectively ensure that the tasks of the affected member are appropriately redistributed.

## Meeting Etiquette
- During meetings, maintain a professional and focused environment.
- Avoid disruptions, side conversations, or unrelated activities.

### Confidentiality and Plagiarism
- Information and work shared among group members must remain within the group.
- To prevent plagiarism, members should refrain from sharing their codes with other students.


### Respect
- Team members are expected to treat each other with respect.


### Accountability and Responsibility
- Each team member is accountable for their assigned tasks and responsibilities.
- If a member is unable to fulfill their duties, they should proactively seek assistance or delegate tasks.
- Accountability is crucial to the success of our project. We expect all team members to fulfill their responsibilities
  and to communicate clearly and honestly with the rest of the team. If a team member fails to complete their work
  between stand-up meetings, an explanation is required. In this case, if the explanation is "I didn't have the
  motivation," the team will accept it, but the member will be expected to catch up and spend double the time to
  make up for the missed work.

- If a team member fails to complete their work for a second time and the explanation is simply "I was lazy," without
  a legitimate reason such as illness, then a strike will be issued. Eelco will be notified of the strike, and the
  team member will be expected to catch up and spend double the time to make up for the missed work.


### Communication Channels
- Utilize designated communication channels (e.g., messaging apps, email) for team discussions and updates.
- Respond promptly to team messages and notifications.


### Documentation and Transparency
- Keep thorough documentation of individual and group progress.
- Be transparent about challenges, setbacks, and changes in project timelines.


### Contribution Equality
- Strive for an equitable distribution of tasks among team members.
- Encourage and value the diverse skills and perspectives each member brings.


### Iterative Feedback
- Provide constructive and respectful feedback to team members on their work.
- Embrace a culture of continuous improvement and learning.


### Technology and Tool Usage
- Follow agreed-upon guidelines for using collaborative tools and technologies.
- Ensure that all team members have access to necessary tools and resources.


### Adherence to Academic Integrity
- Uphold academic integrity standards and avoid any form of cheating or plagiarism.
- Cite sources appropriately and adhere to any academic guidelines provided by the lecturer.


### Flexibility and Adaptability
- Be open to adapting plans and strategies based on the evolving needs of the project.
- Embrace a flexible mindset to navigate unexpected challenges.


### Professionalism
- Conduct yourself in a professional manner in all interactions within the team and with external stakeholders.
- Represent the team positively in academic and professional settings.


### Conflict of Interest
- Disclose any potential conflicts of interest that may impact the team or project.
- Work collaboratively to find solutions that mitigate conflicts and maintain the team's integrity.


### Consequences for Violations
- Clearly outline the consequences for repeated violations of the code of conduct.
- Ensure that consequences are fair and proportionate to the nature of the violation.


## Quality

Quality is paramount to the success of our project. We are committed to delivering a high-standard, error-free solution
that meets the expectations of Parantion. To ensure quality throughout the development process, we adhere to the
following principles:
- Coding Standards: All team members will adhere to established coding standards and best practices for TypeScript.
This includes consistent formatting, meaningful variable names, and proper documentation.
- Code Reviews: Regular code reviews will be conducted to ensure that code quality is maintained. Feedback from reviews
will be constructive and focused on improvement.
- Testing: Comprehensive testing strategies, including unit tests and integration tests, will be implemented to identify
and rectify bugs at an early stage. Each team member is responsible for testing their own code before submitting it for
review.
- communication: Open and transparent communication is essential for effective collaboration. Team members will 
communicate progress, challenges, and updates regularly during meetings and through designated channels.
- Collaboration Tools: Utilization of collaboration tools, such as Gitlab and sharing fil platforms, will be consistent
to facilitate efficient teamwork and organization.
- Documentation: All code will be thoroughly documented to ensure that it is understandable and maintainable. This
includes inline comments and JavaDoc comments for significant methods or components.
- Continuous Improvement: The team will strive for continuous improvement throughout the development process. This
includes learning new skills, incorporating feedback, and adapting to changing requirements.
- Project Management: The team will follow Scrum principles for project management. This includes regular stand-up
meetings, sprint planning, and sprint retrospectives. The team will also utilize a Gitlab board to track progress and
ensure that tasks are completed on time.
- Version Control: The team will utilize Gitlab for version control. This includes committing code regularly, writing
clear commit messages, and pushing code to the repository at the end of each day.
- Security: Security considerations will be taken into account during the development process. This includes following
secure coding practices and mitigating potential vulnerabilities.
- Performance: The team will ensure that the code meets performance requirements specified in the user story. This
includes conducting performance tests and optimizing the code for efficiency.
- Deployment: The team will ensure that the code is ready for deployment to the target environment. This includes
documenting and applying any environment-specific configurations.
- Accountability: Each team member is accountable for their assigned tasks and responsibilities. If a member is unable
to fulfill their duties, they should proactively seek assistance or delegate tasks.
- Flexibility: The team will be open to adapting plans and strategies based on the evolving needs of the project. This
includes embracing a flexible mindset to navigate unexpected challenges.
