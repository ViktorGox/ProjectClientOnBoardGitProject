# Client Communication Log

First communication was on the 29th November when we went to the company.
They showed us a presentation, and then we asked some questions. We do not have exact questions from the meeting, but still some of the questions we asked where:

Is there a need for different roles, like admin privileges and normal ones.
Answer to that was yes.

We had a talk about our choice of technologies. Using Svelte, TypeScript and MySQL.
They said it was ok, no issues.

We asked about how to send a notification about the blocker.
They said any way that is outside our program.

We talked about what permissions should different roles have.


In the discord we asked one question to clarify if we understood the role permissions

''hello we are currently defining the functional design and we where wondering if we have the correct permissions assigned to the correct role:

Tester: change completion state, move between columns, edit description
Developer: edit tests, add tests, remove tests
Admins: reset board, delete tests, add tests, edit tests''
